<h1>30 day of Javascript</h1>

Welcome to my journey through the [30 Days of JavaScript](https://30dayjavascript.js.org/) challenge by Asabeneh Yetayeh! ðŸš€  
This repository contains all my daily solutions, learnings, and mini-projects created during the challenge.

## ðŸ“… Overview

The **30 Days of JavaScript** is a step-by-step coding challenge that covers core JavaScript concepts from beginner to intermediate level.  
It's a great way to build a strong foundation and apply JavaScript in real-world scenarios.

## âœ… Goals

- Reinforce JavaScript fundamentals
- Build hands-on mini projects
- Improve coding consistency and problem-solving skills
- Document and reflect on the learning process
  
## ðŸš€ How to Use

You can browse through each day's folder to see the exercises and projects. Feel free to:
- Clone the repo
- Run the code locally
- Explore the logic
- Tweak and play around to deepen your understanding!

ðŸ§  Lessons Learned
Throughout the 30 days, I've explored:
